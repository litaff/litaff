## Hi there! 👋
I've been exploring the world of code for almost ten years. 😶

# 🛠️ Skills
Languages & Engines: Pure C#, Unity, Godot
Other Challenges: Open to new experiences, including Minecraft modding
# 🎮 Interests
Games are my passion, and I strive to work as close to game development as possible. My goal is to gain extensive knowledge not only in programming but also in 3D, 2D, SFX, and VFX.

My dream is to become a one-man army, capable of creating and delivering all kinds of content—though it may be an ambitious goal! 🚀
